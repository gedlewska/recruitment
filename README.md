# Main.java
Write a function that receives two sequences: A and B of integers and returns one sequence C. Sequence C should contain all elements from sequence A (maintaining the order) except those, that are present in sequence B p times, where p is a prime number.
If n1 is a number of integers in sequence A and n2 is a number of integers in sequence B:
the complexity is O(n2*sqr(n2)/3 + n2 + n1) in thw worst case.
